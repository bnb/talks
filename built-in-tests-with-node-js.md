Built-in Tests with Node.js
```

**Abstract:**
```
For over a decade, a vibrant testing ecosystem evolved naturally in the Node.js ecosystem. Many unique, yet wildly useful tools were built to help us ensure our code does exactly what we expect it to. More recently, as JavaScript has seen the front-end explode with an even more vibrant array of tools, we've seen a distinct break in the ability of popular front-end testing tooling to integrate nicely with Node.js. Further, we've seen an explosion of growth in the runtime ecosystem, with new pressures for unique DX additions - including built-in test libraries. This newfound, multi-faceted pressure resulted in an experiment to add a testing module to Node.js directly - `node:test`. We're going to explore this new, built-in library, resulting in you understanding how you can and why you should use it today.
