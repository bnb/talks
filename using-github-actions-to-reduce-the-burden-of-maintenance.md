# Using GitHub Actions to Reduce The Burden of Maintenance

**Title:**
```
Using GitHub Actions to Reduce The Burden of Maintenance
```

**Abstract:**
```
A few years ago, GitHub released a CI and automation platform, GitHub Actions. While GitHub Actions do serve as a strong CI platform, they also provide an incredible tool for automation. They have some interesting primitives that enable developers to do everything from complicated, multi-step automations that integrate multiple disparate platforms to running simple tasks.

In this talk, I will give JavaScript developers the context they need around the Actions Toolkit, community-built actions they'll probably want to be using, and some not-so-obvious tips and tricks that will enable them to build useful, effective, single-purpose GitHub Actions to help reduce the burden of maintenance - open-source or otherwise.

This talk will cover GitHub Actions, including the underlying systems, SDKs, and community-built tooling around it. Given the massive adoption of GitHub Actions and relevance of GitHub to JavaScript and Open Source, this talk _should_ be able to help lower the maintenance burden on both Open Source maintainers and on ICs working at companies that are using both JavaScript and GitHub.```
