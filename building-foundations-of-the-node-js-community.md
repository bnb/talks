# Building Foundations of the Node.js Community

**Title:**
```
Building Foundations of the Node.js Community
```

**Abstract:**
```
Node.js is a community centric platform. It grew with individuals and startups into something that’s used at a massive scale today.

With the io.js split and the resulting Node.js Foundation, where is that integral community now? Where is it going? And, importantly, how can you get involved?

Node.js is an amazing project in terms of code - it’s evolved rapidly to cover an immense landscape, from web apps, desktop apps, APIs, IoT, robotics, and beyond. There’s something else that Node has also been absolutely killer with, though: the community.

One really awesome thing is that the Node.js community has an established community for building the Node community. How meta is that? The Node.js project is sectioned off into different Working Groups (WGs) that are tasked with different objectives - the one that was tasked with building the community was the Evangelism WG.

That said, there’s a transition happening. The Evangelism WG planted the seed Node.js Community efforts. Now, the Community Committee has taken this a step further and is mobilizing to start exploding the awareness and understanding of Node and its diverse ecosystem.

Attendees will gain an understanding of what the Node.js Community Committee is, what it's goals are, and how they can start getting involved.

**Additional Comments:**
```
I've given this talk in a few different events, and from each event my goal is to get at least a few people engaged enough to the point that they're interesting and want to contribute to the project. I generally try to make myself as available as possible for these individuals and help connect them to the Node.js project and its community.

The aim of my presentation is to expose attendees the ongoing and growing efforts of the Node.js project to directly enable its community, and engage them to the point of contributing back to one of our initiatives in some way.

The Node.js project has had a perception of being an insiders club - a perception that the Community Committee is actively trying to break down. Having discussions about the project and inviting those who may not normally be exposed to the work we do has proven to be one of our best avenues to get more diverse perspectives into the project.
```

**Audience:**
```
Node.js is going through a community revolution right now, and people across the world are interested in the discussions happing around Node.js + Community.

As chairperson of the Node.js Community Committee, I'm working to help empower *anyone* who is interested in Node.js and cares about enabling people of all kinds to contribute to OSS, build awesome applications, learn to code, or otherwise engage with Node.js.
