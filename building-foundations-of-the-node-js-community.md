# Building the Foundations of the Node.js Community

**Title:**
```
Building Foundations of the Node.js Community
```

**Abstract:**
```
Node.js is a community centric platform. It grew with individuals and startups into something that’s used at a massive scale today.

With the io.js split and the resulting Node.js Foundation, where is that integral community now? Where is it going? And, importantly, how can you get involved?

```
Node.js is an amazing project in terms of code - it’s evolved rapidly to cover an immense landscape, from web apps, desktop apps, APIs, IoT, robotics, and beyond. There’s something else that Node has also been absolutely killer with, though: the community.

One really awesome thing is that the Node.js community has an established community for building the Node community. How meta is that? The Node.js project is sectioned off into different Working Groups (WGs) that are tasked with different objectives - the one that was tasked with building the community was the Evangelism WG.

That said, there’s a transition happening. The Evangelism WG planted the seed Node.js Community efforts. Now, the Community Committee has taken this a step further and is mobilizing to start exploding the awareness and understanding of Node and its diverse ecosystem.

Attendees will gain an understanding of what the Node.js Community Committee is, what it's goals are, and how they can start getting involved.

Node.js is an amazing project in terms of code - it’s evolved rapidly to cover an immense landscape, from web apps, desktop apps, APIs, IoT, robotics, and beyond. There’s something else that Node has also been absolutely killer with, though: the community.

When the community split off of the core Node project into io.js, things changed dramatically. Suddenly, the community was in charge - of everything. The project wasn’t under the control of a small few, but rather it adapted to enable the project to be entirely controlled by the community.

Great - Node.js is governed by its community. But how does the Node community grow? How should it communicate? How can it encourage people to stop by and give Node.js a try - and hopefully not get thrown into a catch()?

One really awesome thing is that the Node.js community has an established community for building the Node community. How meta is that? The Node.js project is sectioned off into different Working Groups (WGs) with that are tasked with different objectives - the one that was tasked with building the community was the Evangelism WG.

Now, we’re seeing step two in process of building the Community for the Community: The Node.js Community Committee.

There have been several new developments, such as…

Scaffolding out processes for the community to become technical editors to The Node.js Collection (https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection)

Moving community education efforts like nodejs/education and NodeTogether into a central place

Developing the documentation around the Community Committee to enable the Community to develop and grow naturally

These are the buds of momentum that is building for new community-based content that we’re seeing a need for as Node.js is growing, spreading, and diversifying.

All that said, there’s a transition happening. The Evangelism WG planted the seed of the grassroots Node.js Community efforts. Now, the Community Committee has taken this a step further and is mobilizing to start exploding the awareness and understanding of Node and its diverse ecosystem.

To succeed with this effort around enabling the Node.js community, we’re going to need help.

We’re going to need help.

We’re going to need ideas.

We’re going to need feedback.

We’re going to need people.

We’re going to need the community.

We need you.
```

**Pitch:**
```
Node.js is going through a community revolution right now, and people across the world are interested in the discussions happing around Node.js + Community. I am a co-chair of the Community Committee, the group leading the charge the greenfield Node.js community efforts.
