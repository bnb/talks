# Building Open Source Communities

**Title:**
```
Building Open Source Communities
```

**Elevator Pitch:**
```
Building Open Source Communities is hard. There's a lot of people that do it, but we repeat the _hard lessons_  again and again. 

In this talk, I go over the overlapping lessons I've had from four distinct OSS communities to help the next generation of Builders... build.
```

**1000 Characters:**
```
We talk about community a lot in open source. Communities can make or break any open source project.

There are some common traits–universal lessons that can be taken from working with open source communities–that any open source community can benefit from understanding and approaching thoughtfully.

So what are common traits amongst successful–and not so successful–communities? How can you begin to apply the lessons others have learned, instead of re-inventing the wheel? Most importantly, how can you help ensure _your_ community is successful?
```

**Takeaways:**
```
Attendees will walk away with a nw understanding of how to approach building open source communities successfully. Whether they're trying to kick off something new or are driving an existing open source community, they'll be able to walk away with things they can begin to implement and improve.
