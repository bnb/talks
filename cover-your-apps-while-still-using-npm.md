```
Cover Your Apps While Still Using npm
```

**Abstract:**
```
npm has outages and issues. Itâ€™s a SaaS platform - it unavoidably happens. What happens when a 2 LOC dependency youâ€™ve never heard of breaks your builds?

npm is an extremely flexible tool, and thereâ€™s an entire ecosystem of tooling to enable you to cover your apps you should be using. Are you?
```


**1000 Characters:**
```
In the front-end and Node.js ecosystems, weâ€™ve had two extinction-level events: left-pad and pinkie-promise.

These events were both caused by something simple - a module became temporarily unavailable. Something seemingly innocuous caused thousands of developers and businesses builds to break and installs to fail. They werenâ€™t prepared, and many were eager to blame npm as the single point of failure of the entire JavaScript ecosystem.

In reality, npm has made it dead-simple for developers and organizations to make sure their modules and highly available. The majority of the ecosystem isnâ€™t aware of this, nor do they implement it effectively.

In this talk, weâ€™ll go over how the dependency tree works at a high level, how you can get bitten by it, and how you can cover your apps - both as developer and as a business.

**Takeaways:**
```
Attendees will leave with an understanding of the more obscure parts of npm and what they're actually getting when they install a module. They'll learn how to set up safeguards - at a personal and professional level - against the common issues that npm has as a platform, so they don't get bitten by the next `left-pad` incident or registry outage.
