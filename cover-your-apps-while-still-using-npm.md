# Cover Your Apps While Still Using npm

**Title:**
```
Cover Your Apps While Still Using npm
```

**Abstract / Pitch:**
```
npm has outages and issues. Itâ€™s a SaaS platform - it unavoidably happens. What happens when a 2 LOC dependency youâ€™ve never heard of breaks your builds?

In this talk, Tierney will cover the spectrum of tooling available to end-users - no matter if they're indie developers or enterprise teams - to ensure that they're not exposing themselves to risk when modules they depend upon from npm - whether they know it or not - become unavailable.
```


**1000 Characters:**
```
In the front-end and Node.js ecosystems, weâ€™ve had two extinction-level events: left-pad and pinkie-promise.

These events were both caused by something simple - a module became temporarily unavailable. Something seemingly innocuous caused thousands of developers and businesses builds to break and installs to fail. They werenâ€™t prepared, and many were eager to blame npm as the single point of failure of the entire JavaScript ecosystem.

In reality, npm has made it dead-simple for developers and organizations to make sure their modules and highly available. The majority of the ecosystem isnâ€™t aware of this, nor do they implement it effectively.

In this talk, weâ€™ll go over how the dependency tree works at a high level, how you can get bitten by it, and how you can cover your apps - both as developer and as a business.

**Takeaways:**
```
Attendees will leave with an understanding of the more obscure parts of npm and what they're actually getting when they install a module. They'll learn how to set up safeguards - at a personal and professional level - against the common issues that npm has as a platform, so they don't get bitten by the next `left-pad` incident or registry outage.
```

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**
```
The Node.js and JavaScript ecosystems have - on several occasions - called npm the Single Point of Failure (SPoF) for modern web development. The intent of this talk is to educate developers that this is in fact not the case, and that the npm team has done everything in their power to enable us, the end-users, to deploy successfully. End-users will be exposed to an ecosystem of tooling and resources available to ensure high-availablity of their dependencies, so they won't be bitten by the next left-pad or pinkie-promise.
