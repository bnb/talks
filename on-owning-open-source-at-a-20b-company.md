# On Owning Open Source at a $20b Company

**Title:**
```
On Owning Open Source at a $20b Company
```

**Abstract:**
```
I'll share as much as I possibly can about what I've learned from managing three Open Source organizations for a company valued at over $20b, including mistakes and how to avoid them early, how to partner with internal teams for more reach and success, and existing tools you can start using.
```

**Full:**
```
Coming from the background of helping to running open source organizations like Node.js and Electron and being a founding contributor of the OpenJS Foundation, I'm exceptionally familiar with running large scale open source.

Moving into Twilio from Microsoft, I rapidly took on the responsibilities of full ownership of Twilio's public GitHub organizations - Twilio and Twilio Labs. In the three years since, I've helped the company navigate choppy waters and shore up our open source position, cleaning up well intended but potentially disastrous historical choices while also planning for the future and ensuring that whoever takes over once I'm gone is set up for success.

In attending, you'll learn about:

- simple GitHub Organization mistakes and their solutions that can save you years of effort
- why (and how!) you need to find internal teams to partner with for long-term success
- existing tools that can be implemented now to help you later
