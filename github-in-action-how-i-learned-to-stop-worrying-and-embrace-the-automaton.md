**Title:** GitHub in Action: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Automaton

**Elevator:**
```
GitHub has been rolling out features like Apps and Actions that are perfect for solving many of the problems JavaScript is now facing as it's ecosystem continues to grow at an incredible rate. Learn how to use GitHub Apps and GitHub Actions to automate away the hard parts of modern JavaScirpt.

**Full:**

GitHub has been rolling out a suite of tools that have enabled the JavaScript community to begin the process of building mass automation for the unique problems that we face when compared to classical programming languages. These tools – namely, GitHub Actions and GitHub Apps – allow us as JavaScript developers to focus more on code and automate away the tedious parts of the modern JavaScript ecosystem.

Whether it's updating dependencies, checking for vulnerabilities, or deploying to The Cloud, you shouldn't be doing any repetitive or intensive tasks. Manually approaching these tasks both wastes tremendous amounts of time and introduces a margin of human error into them.

As the JavaScript ecosystem continues to expand at an unprecedented speed, we're seeing a total information overload. A single `npm install` can let us know about *hundreds* of issues that we need to act on immediately to ensure our code is secure, reliable, and maintainable – never mind the feedback from dozens of other tools we introduce to help us be more productive as we're writing code. Automating workflows, dependency management, vulnerability monitoring, and virtually every other aspect of development other than writing code is vital to ensuring we're able to continue to be productive as developers. Why waste time resolving issues that can be automated?

**Key Takeaways:**
```
- Key GitHub Apps and Actions that already exist to reduce developer pain in the following areas:
  - Dependency Management
  - Security / Known Vulnerabilities
  - Deployment
- Demonstrate how the key apps/actions would have protected JavaScript developers from major ecosystem vulnerabilities in the past ~3 years
- Ways JavaScript developers – as individuals and teams – can start building their own Apps and Actions today
  - Probot
  - actions-toolkit
  - Useful Docker images
