# Talks
This repo is a source of truth for the source material of talks I propose and give. 

## Goals
Goal is to add at least one new talk a year. I'm still a relatively new public speaker, but want to continue on a path to growth as one. 

## Current Outlines
* [Building Foundations of the Node.js Community](./building-foundations-of-the-node-js-community.md)
* [Cover Your Apps While Still Using npm](./cover-your-apps-while-still-using-npm.md)
