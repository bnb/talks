# Talks
This repo is a source of truth for the source material of talks I propose and give. 

## Goals
Goal is to add at least one new talk a year. I'm still a relatively new public speaker, but want to continue on a path to growth as one. 

## Current Talks
* [Building the Foundations of the Node.js Community](https://github.com/bnb/talks/blob/master/building-the-foundations-of-the-node-js-community.md)
