How to Start Contributing To Open-Source
```

**Abstract:**
```
Open-source software has become a foundational piece of modern software engineering, existing as the platform for everything from personal projects to the most successful products. Open-source is often framed as a good way to garner both visibility and experience, but in that assertion there's a lot of assumptions about how you'll participate. In this talk, we'll cover basics of contributing to open-source and discuss tooling, ettiquite, and self-care with the goal of preparing you to start making meaningful contributions to an existing open-source project.
